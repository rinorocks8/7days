Calendar using Google Calender and Tasks APIs

This code is pretty sloppy

Future Plans:
Switch to Redux for state management
Switch extraProperties to store IDs and not values
Switch from using flex to grids for rows
Add ability to add new columns

Known Bugs:
Changing a dropdown option's text or color does not update the default settings and requires them to be reset
